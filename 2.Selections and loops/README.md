# Selections and loops

* Program can do different things depending on conditions it is given

## Selection
* Here the program executes an instruction when a condition is met and executes a different instruction if that condition is not met
*        if statement
syntax
    if (condition)
        statement1;
    else
        statement2i;

if is a the key word that introduces the program into the if statement.
you can use curly braces when more than than one statements are supposed to be checked.
    if (condition)
        {
            statement1;
            statement2;
        }
    else
        {
            statement3;
            statement4;
        }  

In some cases the else case can be omitted if no other statement is to be performed. The program will just continue to the other statements after the curly braces.

## Loops
### while loop

this loop here will keep executing an instruction until a given condition is met.
The loop will keep on repeating.

while (condition)
{
    statements
}

### for loop
here a condition is given to a program and it is to execute an instruction for a specified number of timesaccording to the condition.

for (initiation; condition; increment)
{
    statements
}
